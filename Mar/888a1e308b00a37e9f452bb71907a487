“This is clearly evident with the garden rapidly desiccating,” he lamented.  Our maximum February rainfall occurred in 2009 – a lovely 186.2mm – and the lowest recorded was only 5.0mm in 1999. “So, we have had worse than 2022!” Jim recorded a meagre 1.7 mm in Park Road from 24 February to 2 March, which was pipped by Paul Maylam’s 2 mm in Cathcart Street.  Meanwhile, Robin Stobbs recorded a “miserable” 0.6 mm in Grant Street. “Maybe if I fitt a bigger collector cup to my pluvio, I could record more?” he quipped.  Temperatures ranged from 17-31 degrees Celcius with most days hitting the 30C mark.  Accuweather predicted some promising rain for Thursday night and Friday. We’ll see.
