The coalition aims “to be a dynamic space for children’s rights and protection practitioners to deliberate and collectively act on matters affecting the lives of children in Makhanda,” said Anna Talbot from Rhodes University Community Engagement. School counsellors, members of the SAPS, the Rhodes University Community Engagement and NGOs involved in child care were amongst stakeholders present at the launch. The launch gave stakeholders an opportunity to network and engage in activities that made them brainstorm ways to further the advocacy for children’s rights and care.
