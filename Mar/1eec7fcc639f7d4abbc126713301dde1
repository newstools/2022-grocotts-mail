Youth from 10 local schools and two tertiary institutions performed a joyful and moving programme to enthralled sold-out audiences. The opening number Yele Yele Masicule performed by the Masicule massed choir provided a blast of energy that remained undimmed for over two hours.  The concert was a timely reawakening of the city’s soul.  Standouts included the Khutliso Daniels Senior Secondary School Choir rendition of an African medley conducted by Lonwabo Sandi and a spine-tingling performance from perennial favourites the Victoria Girls High School Choir, conducted by Sibusiso Mkhize.  Mkhize also conducted newcomers the Eastcape Midlands College Choir and participated in a spirited version of O Sole Mio by the six-man Tenors in Tuxes.  Kutlwano Kepadisa conducted a combined choir for schools with no choir of their own, and the Nelson Mandela Bay University Choir was the first out-of-town choir to perform at Masicule. Renowned artist-activist and FNB Vita Award Winner, Sibongile Mngoma, brought the house down with a rousing version of Brenda Fassie’s Black President with the considerable backing of the Masicule! massed choir.   Several audience members noted that their Covid-19 masks were wet with tears (of joy) by the end of the evening.   Masicule’s fame has travelled far and wide across the globe.
