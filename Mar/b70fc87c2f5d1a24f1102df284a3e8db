Exercise or movement is vital for a healthy body; it improves brain function, sleep, coordination and increases energy levels. It can also help with bone strength, weight loss, prevention of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cholesterol, depression, and high blood pressure.  The minimum amount of exercise for 18-64 year-olds should be 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and/or brisk walking per week. At least two days a week should consist of high-intensity exercise and resistance training such as weightlifting, bodyweight movements, gymnastic orientated workouts. Anyone 65 years and older should aim for 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and/or walking per week. They should give two days a week to strengthen muscles at a low to moderate intensity, such as weight training or bodyweight movement. They can also focus on activities that increase or improve balance.  How to motivate yourself to exercise: On the other hand, there is such a thing as too much exercise. This is where rest and recovery become vital.  How you know you are doing too much and should rest:  If you think you are over-exercising, take a few rest days to recuperate. Drink lots of water, eat lots of food, and catch up on sleep.  Exercise and movement are crucial for overall health and wellbeing.
