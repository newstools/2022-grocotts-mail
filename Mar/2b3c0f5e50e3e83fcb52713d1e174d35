The battle for league honours is heating up nicely in the Makana LFA as teams fought hard in last weekend’s fixtures.  It was a good weekend for the struggling Makana Tigers as they played a goalless draw against Rhodes and edged Sophia Stars 2-1 in a tightly contested game.  City Pirates cemented their pole position in stream A with 4-3 and 5-3 victories over Rhodes and Joza Callies, respectively, while Xl Attackers kept their stream B lead by beating Cameroon 7-0 and Grahamstown United 2-0.  It was not a good weekend for the 6SAI Army team as they lost both of their games to Seven Fountains-based teams Pumba Pirates and Lalibela Lions, by 0-1 and 1-2, respectively.  Makana Celtics redeemed themselves from that 10-2 thrashing by Lalibela lions and beat Newseekers by two unanswered goals. Joza Callies pushed Love and Peace further down from the title contenders as they beat them 2-0 while Sophia Stars beat Young Eagles in an entertaining encounter, with both teams displaying good football and showcasing their young talent.
