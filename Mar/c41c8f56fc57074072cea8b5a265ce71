Jacaranda Aces played host to Young Pirates from Port Alfred in their SAB regional league game at a packed JD Dlepu stadium on Saturday.  The game lived up to the crowd’s expectations as both teams displayed good and entertaining football. The home side created several chances in the first half compared to their opponents but failed to convert any of them. After the break, both teams started where they left off but still failed to use the chances they created.  Aces’ goalkeeper was called on to do some work on numerous occasions by Pirates but was equal to the task as he pulled off excellent saves to keep his team in the game.  Aphelele Tyelbooi squandered a last-minute opportunity after dribbling past three defenders and was left one on one with the keeper, but his teammate got in the way. Both teams had to settle with a point apiece.  It was a much-improved performance by Aces as they kept the ball and passed it around nicely while creating scoring chances. This is precisely how they need to play, especially here at home; they need to play without fear.
