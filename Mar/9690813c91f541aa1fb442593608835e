A Joza scrap metal dealer was arrested on Monday, 7 March, after 120 kilograms of copper was confiscated from his business premises. Visible Policing members acted on intelligence information about a scrap metal dealer alleged to be illegally trading in copper. A consignment was already packed and ready to be delivered to Gqeberha when police pounced on the premises. A preliminary investigation revealed that a dealer had contravened the Secondhand Goods Act.  Police seized 120 kilograms of copper for further investigation. A 59-year-old man was arrested and will soon appear in Makhanda magistrate’s court on a charge of theft. Hi-Tec Security reported that copper pipe theft had “become prolific in all areas” in its February crime report. The security company suggested combating copper pipe theft with “electric boundary fencing with external beams”.   According to police spokesperson Sergeant Majola Nkohli, the SAPS invited stakeholders like Telkom, Eskom, Transnet and the Makana Municipality to identify some of the copper items that were seized during the arrest. Sarah Baartmaan District Commander, Brigadier John Lebok commended members for a well-coordinated and swift action resulting in the arrest.   He said scrap metal dealers have to follow the law and keep registers of all their transactions.   “Each customer must furnish a copy of the identity card and address details to the dealer, who in turn has to keep those records in the registers so as to combat theft of copper by unscrupulous thieves and robbers hellbent on making a quick buck while other community members suffer.”
