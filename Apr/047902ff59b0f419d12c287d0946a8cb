“If only the rain around the country could be more evenly distributed, sparing KZN this terrible tragedy,” he commented. Jim Cambray measured a little more, 13.5mm, in Park Road.  “Unlike some parts of the country getting over 300mm in a day! So we can appreciate the 13.5mm and not 300mm!” he said. Temperatures ranged from a cool 11 Celcius to 24C.
