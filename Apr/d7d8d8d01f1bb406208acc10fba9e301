Astonishment and disbelief barely cover my reaction to the news that legitimately elected councillors can be so easily ousted with no legal process. Social media hardly qualifies as a ‘legal process’. For decades I have faithfully paid my rates and taxes to the Makana Municipality on the understanding that our representatives were OUR representatives, legally elected to a public body constituted in law. This is apparently no longer the case. Rather than pay to support an illegal organisation, I feel obliged to withhold payment of my rates and redirect them into a holding account until the legally elected representatives of the people are reinstated. I trust other dismayed citizens will follow suit. Yours faithfully,Helen Holleman
