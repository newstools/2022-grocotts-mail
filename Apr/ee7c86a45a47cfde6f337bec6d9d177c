This Freedom Day, 27 April, The Black Power Station and collaborators will host an event at the Old Power Station, Rautenbach Road, in the industrial area.  The event is themed around what Freedom Day means from various perspectives ranging from the politics of gender, religious equality, and the unpacking of the legacies of apartheid. Performances will include poetry, storytelling and music. The entrance is free and the start time is noon. Freedom Day commemorates South Africa’s first free elections in 1994. The Black Power Station CEO Xolile Madinda said the event would look at this history through the eyes of the present in the light of society’s current problems. “On this day, we want to see how we can come forward with practical ideas for helping ourselves to free the mind. With the goal of obtaining absolute freedom for the mind,  we will bring everyone under one roof to enjoy music, food, and the diversity of cultures we have in Makhanda”.
