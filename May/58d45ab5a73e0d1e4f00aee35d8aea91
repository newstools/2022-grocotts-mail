Excited long-distance runner, Lionel Blaauw, returned to Makhanda from the Two Oceans Ultra Marathon 2022 carrying a bronze medal and feeling inspired. Blaauw said his trip to Cape Town gave him a positive perspective on life. It showed him the importance of moving out of one’s comfort zone and that one must not judge nor undermine themselves because of dire circumstances. “You never know what the future holds, whatever you are currently yearning for might be given to you tomorrow,” he said. He thanked his sponsors – KS Auto Spares, Just Property, Mrs Godlonton, the Makhanda community and Ikhala Vet Clinic. Without their support, his trip would not have happened.  Blaauw said she would like to participate in the upcoming Sanlam Cape Town Marathon, but as an unemployed living off piece jobs, he could not afford it.
