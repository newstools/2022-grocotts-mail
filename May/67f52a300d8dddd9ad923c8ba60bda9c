The single bed quilt – expertly sewn in Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow with a sunflower theme – was raffled on www.justgiving.com/fundraising/quogs.  Tomorrow afternoon a Ukrainian citizen will draw a winner’s name at the home of one of the QUOGS, Karen Davies. The QUOGS – currently comprised of ten Makhanda women – have met once a week for 20 years.  One of the QUOGS, Mariss Stevens, documented the process of making the Ukrainian quilt on her blog.  Each donation of $10 bought one ‘ticket’ and a chance to win the unique quilt.  Grocott’s Mail will bring you news from the draw on Thursday.
