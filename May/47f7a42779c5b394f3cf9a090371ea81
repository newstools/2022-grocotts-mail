Many of us will have to endure the ending of a romantic relationship, a breaking up of something that once brought us joy.  This article is my guide on how to get over it. It is not a perfect plan, and to be honest, I am busy making my way through this experience, going through the ending of a “situationship.” I have not quite figured out the process myself, but this is my attempt to help others to hopefully not feel so alone.  Let us admit this upfront; breakups are difficult. You may experience physical aches, itchy fingers to message, phone or contact your ex, and constant thoughts about them and continuous thoughts about whether you were good enough.  No matter why or how the breakup happened, whether amicable or one-sided, it is not an easy process. A one-sided breakup, especially if you were broken up with, can be difficult. It may seem like the other person doesn’t care about you, even though they are probably going through their own experience at this ending.  In my case, my friends have repeatedly told me not to message, call or contact him, which makes me want to do so even more. But they are my friends for a reason, so I do think they have a point.  This leads me to some tips that I have found helpful: There is no hard and fast way to put yourself back together after a breakup, precisely because you are not broken. The person was not right for you, and accepting that you are better off without someone who may not have seen your value or have been a good fit for you will help you go a long way in your healing process.  It is much better to be alone than with someone who does not see your worth or is not a good fit for you.
