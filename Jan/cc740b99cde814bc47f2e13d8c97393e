Willows batsmen struggled to get in terms with the conditions and lost two early wickets due to disciplined bowling by the hosts. They pulled through without losing many wickets and ended with a moderate 107/4 in their allotted 20 overs. The inform number three batsman Cariston Haarhof batted superbly and with composure, top-scoring with a hard-fought 38 and put up a decent partnership with Abner Accom, who contributed 24. He and the hard-hitting Marquin Loutz came in and blasted a quick-fire unbeaten cameo of 24*
Jamie Renton 2/28 (4), Francois Klopper 1/13 (4), and Ryan Beydeveldt 1/31 (4) were the wicket-takers for Cuylerville. Willows came out firing in pursuit to defend their target. Their bowlers kept the pressure on throughout the intense encounter and kept the opposition batsmen at bay.
