By CHRIS TOTOBELA Makhanda’s pride and WBF All Africa champion Mzoxolo “Black Tiger ” Ndwayana is hard at training preparing for his trip to Namibia. Ndwayana will be challenging current WBO Africa Welterweight champion Charles Shinima in a 12-round contest. Shinima has an impressive record of 13 fights and 13 wins with nine knockouts and is yet to taste defeat. This mouth-watering and much-anticipated contest will take place on 19 March 2022 in Helao Nafidi, Namibia. Black Tiger’s trainer and father, Bulelani Ndwayana, said the fight was a perfect opportunity to “add one more title in our camp”. “We don’t know much about Shinima, but looking at his record, he seems like a very good boxer. We have approached all the experts in our region to come and help us prepare for this fight.” Hopefully, this will be a much better fight for our local hero than what he went through in his last fight against DRC’s Kuvesa. The Black Tiger is preparing to go the distance with Shinima. Still, if the opportunity to knock him out presents itself, he will gladly take it with both hands as it will be challenging to impress the judges in Shinima’s backyard. Ndwayana and his crew will be leaving for Namibia a week before the big fight, and the whole of Makhanda and South Africa will be fully behind them to bring the title back home.
