By CHESLEY DANIELS Sidbury Cricket Club 2nd Team recorded a record win against Kenton in their Grahamstown Cricket Board (GCB) 2nd League fixture played at Sidbury Sports Club on Saturday 21 January. Sidbury 2nds recorded their highest team total of 564 and made history by beating Kenton with a 527- run margin. This is the highest win margin by a team in the GCB 2nd League. This was the only league match over the weekend as it was a postponed fixture from last year. The game was played in sweltering weather conditions and was an entertaining and exciting game of cricket. Sidbury batted first and took full advantage of the batting-friendly pitch, scoring a mammoth 564/7 in their allotted 50 overs. Kenton got off to a brilliant start with left-arm seamer Viren Cook clinching the wicket of Captain Bruce Main for a duck. But Kenton bowlers lost the plot, and it was the Sidbury batsmen who took complete control of the game and hammered the visitor’s bowlers all over the park. Man of the Match Jason Maclachlan, the leading run-scorer in the 2nd League, scored a magnificent 180 runs and was 20 short of his first double century. He was in devastating form with the bat and smashed the bowlers all over the park. He also scored a few centuries this season. Then in came a tired Dean Upman who wasted no time in the heat and scored a quickfire half-century in no time. Upman ended with a hurricane 79 and put up a fantastic 200+ partnership with another centurion Jade Bowles. Bowles continued, and even after a slow start to his innings, he accelerated towards the end to reach his first century for Sidbury. He needed 26 runs off the last over to reach his century and do just that, in fine fashion. Bowles ended with an unbeaten 102* while Cameron Christie also contributed 31. Wicket takers for Kenton were: Brett 3/103 (10), Cook 1/51 (10), Steve 1/83 (9), Tony 1/83 (6). After a fairly decent start, Kenton lost wickets in no time due to magnificent bowling by the home side. Sidbury’s bowlers were on top of their game and bowled aggressively and on target. The game ended shortly afterwards as Kenton were bowled out for a mere 37 runs in just 8.2 overs. Openers Juandre Nel and Cameron Christie was in devastating form with the ball and bowled with aggression and decent pace up front. Nel took 4/13 (4.2) and Christie 4/14 (4) and also on a hat trick. Sidbury won by a massive 527 runs and a bonus point. GCB 2nd League Log
