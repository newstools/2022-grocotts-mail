We all go through different life events and new experiences, such as changing schools, moving to a new city, changing jobs, possibly moving countries, and changing lifestyles.  This can all be frightening because it is unknown. Changes in our circumstances can bring about anxiety because we must start all over again and move away from our comfort zone, especially if the change is out of our control. This can also possibly cause feelings of disempowerment or loss.  We are naturally wired to fear change as humans. We prefer routine and consistency. Change brings a lack of safety because we do not know whether the change will be good or bad for us. This dates back to our ancestors who wanted structure and routine – otherwise, there could be dehydration, lack of resources, and even death.  Our mental health also fares best when we have routine and control. If we lose this sense of safety, our mental health can take a dip. When we follow a routine, our life is predictable, relieving anxiety and stress.  Change can, however, be positive, which means that knowing how to cope with a fear of the unknown may be helpful.  Some tips on how to cope with change:  Sometimes change is necessary and unavoidable. These tips for coping will hopefully help make the transition easier. It is okay to feel overwhelmed by change, but acknowledging and working through it will help.
