Two of the ILAM shows will form part of the Curated Programme. Thandeka Mfinyongo, a PhD student in Ethnomusicology, will be performing “Ingoduko“. With her band and a guest appearance by jazz musician Dumza Maswana, Mfinyongo will be performing vocals and uhadi and umrhubhe. Boudina McConnachie, Senior Lecturer of Ethnomusicology, will be collaborating on a sound exhibition with Dr Dylan McGarry, a Senior Researcher at the Environmental Learning Research Centre (ELRC), called “Our ocean is sacred; you can’t mine heaven“. Other collaborators include Makhanda-based photographer Luke Kaplan, Michaela Howse from the Keiskamma Art Project, and the Woodstock Art Reef Project: Abundance. The third ILAM show will be included in the Fringe Programme. Nombasa Maqoko, a Master’s student in Ethnomusicology, will be performing original songs from her self-titled album, “Nombasa“. Makhanda-born, this talented singer/songwriter, produces “soulful music that evokes emotion and simultaneously celebrates life and diversity”. This songstress has shared stages with Msaki, Asanda Mqiki, Zahara, Nkunz’ eMdaka, Blessing Chimanda, Vusi Mahlasela, and others. In 2016, her debut performance in the Fringe Programme at NAF earned her an Ovation Award, followed by the Cape Fringe Bronze award.
