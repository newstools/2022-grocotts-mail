The stigmatisation of mental health continues, even though we have seen great strides in how we as a society discuss mental health issues, and there are more and more social media posts about mental health.  Stigmatisation, in this instance, refers to cases where people are prejudicial towards someone due to the state of their mental health. This can occur in the workplace, home, friendship groups, and public settings.   In 2019, stigma in the workplace was incredibly high concerning mental health. This meant that then, and still, now, many employees do not want to come forward if they have a mental health issue because they fear discrimination and marginalisation. Stigma can be a significant deterrent to those needing to seek help.  Examples of stigmatised talk towards someone with mental health issues:  Many people do not seek help for their mental health issues because they fear the repercussions of seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist, being on medication, and speaking about their problems.  The stigma around mental health is caused by a lack of awareness, education, and perception around mental illnesses. It is, therefore, vital for us to educate others on what stigma is.  More than one billion people have mental illness worldwide. The WHO highlights the need to transform awareness around mental health.  How to decrease stigma against those who have mental health issues:  The stigma of mental health is still a problem, and it is up to us as a community to spread the word about this.  Educate yourselves and others about mental health.
