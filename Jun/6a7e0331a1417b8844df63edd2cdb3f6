I have had the displeasure of meeting my very own narcissist. They infiltrated my life to such an extent and wreaked havoc before I realized what was happening. I have been trying to separate from them for months, but for those who have had a narcissist enter their lives, it is safe to say that this is extremely difficult to achieve.  A narcissist is someone with an exaggerated sense of self-importance, excessive need for admiration, lack of empathy, a loss of identity, difficulty with attachment and dependency, chronic feelings of boredom and emptiness, and a fear of change.  The empath is the opposite of this, and often narcissists and empaths find each other because of the empath’s need to “fix” someone and the narcissist’s need to “break someone down to be dependent on them.” This is how people often find themselves in a relationship or romantic entanglement with a narcissist.  Narcissists struggle to connect emotionally with others but desire this above all else. They usually cheat, lie, and manipulate to get what they want from others.  Narcissistic signs of abuse include:  These are all authentic examples that I have experienced, along with countless others. Try to avoid the narcissist before they entrap you.  Narcissistic abuse is traumatic and very difficult to come back from. You want to avoid these types of relationships at all costs. You need to take care of your wellbeing above all else, so choose carefully who you invite into your life.
