Most accommodation in the heart of Makhanda is fully booked, but there are township homestays and guest houses outside town to fall back on.  The Makana Tourism website lists option for those wanting to escape the festival rush in town. Kenton-On-Sea and Port Alfred are quiet beach towns where you can mix some of that Fest energy with salty sea air.  For example, Sheilan House is a child-friendly bed & breakfast located in Port Alfred, 49 minutes away from Makhanda. Guests there can enjoy free breakfast and Wi-Fi.  Just 40 minutes from Makhanda on the way to Kenton, Assegaai Trails offers self-catering accommodation and a range of outdoor activities, including bird watching, canoeing, hiking, and rafting.  For those wanting to stay in town, Imbokodo zase Makhanda (Rocks of Makhanda) Homestays is passionate about offering affordable and comfortable accommodation with the feel of Xhosa hospitality.  Prices range from R500 – R550. The latter mostly applies when the space is not shared.   For more information contact the following:
