Pick n Pay family store staff visited Little Flower Pre-School as part of their Mandela Day initiative this week.   They spent 67 minutes with the children and donated groceries to them.  John Campbell of Pick n Pay was happy that his business took time off to think about the less fortunate and made a difference in the community.  Speaking on behalf of Little Flower Pre-School, Nomalungelo Mthwalo thanked Pick n Pay for everything they have done for the school and believed it would make a big difference.
