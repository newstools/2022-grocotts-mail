Former Makhanda’s football giants Santos FC are finding life very difficult in the lower ranks as they lost both of their games 1-4 and 1-2 to Young stars and African Spears, respectively.  Early title contenders and stream A leaders Black Stars collected maximum points as they defeated African Spears and Young Stars by 3-2 and 4-1, respectively. Sophia Stars humiliated Young Ones by eight unanswered goals on Saturday before beating Maru Academy 4-2 on Sunday.  Stream B strugglers Leicester City had a bad weekend as they suffered two defeats at the hands of Vukani Anchors and Rieby United, 0-1 and 1-8. Stream B log leaders Golden Eagles were held to a 4-4 draw by Seven Stars while Golden brothers suffered their heaviest defeat at the hands of Eagles 2-13.  In the main game of the weekend, which got the football lovers at the edge of their seats, Seven Stars came from two goals down to secure a 2-2 draw against Eagles. This action-packed game started at an electrifying pace with Eagles dominating the proceedings, but they failed to capitalise on the sloppy defence of Stars. Eagles defence panicked and threw away a two-goal lead.  Seven Stars had a glorious chance to win it in the last few seconds of the game, but their striker shot wide at goal with the keeper on the ground. Rieby United enjoyed a good weekend as well, as they put five past Golden Brothers.  Maru Academy thrashed Jacaranda Academy by five unanswered goals in the battle of the SAB regional league club’s academies.
